# Introduction
## course outline
- introduction to window functions
- fetching, ranking, and paging
- aggregate window functions and frames
- beyond window functions

## window functions
- perform an operation across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row
- similar to `GROUP BY` aggregate functions, but all rows remain in the output
__uses__
- fetching values from preceding or following rows
  - determining reigning champion status
  - calculating growth over time
- assigning ordinal rank(1st, 2nd,...) to rows based on their values' positions in a sorted list
- running totals, moving averages

## Anatomy of a window function
- FUNCTION_NAME() OVER(...)
  - ORDER BY
  - PARTITION BY
  - ROWS/RANGE PRECEDING/FOLLOWING/UNBOUNDED
