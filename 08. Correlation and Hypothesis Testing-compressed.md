# Hypothesis testing
## why do we need to know about hypothesis testing?
- hypothesis testing is used to compare populations
- hypothesis testing is everywhere
  - can a change in price lead to increased revenue?
  - will changing a website address result in increased traffic?
  - is a medication effective in the treatment of a health condition?
 
## the history of hypothesis testing
- hypothesis testing dates back to the 1700s
- human sex ratio
  - more male births than female births
 
## assume nothing
- start by assuming no difference exists
- this is called the null hypothesis

## male versus female birth ratio
- null hypothesis:
  - no difference in gender birth ratio between women who do and do not take vitamin C consumption
- alternative hypothesis:
  - a difference exists in gender birth ratio between the two populations
  - more female births occur among women taking vitamin C supplements
 
## hypothesis testing workflow
- define the target populations
  - adult women taking or not taking vitamin C supplements
- develop null and alternative hypotheses
  - births are equally like to be male or female in both populations
  - more births are female among women taking vitamin C supplements
- collect or access sample data
- perform statistical tests on the sample data
- draw conclusions about the population

## how much data do we need?
- central limit theorem
  - mean male and female births gets closer to the population means as sample size increases
  - time and resource intensive
- look at peer-reviewed research on similar hypothesis tests to decide on the sample size

## independent and dependent variables
- independent variable:
  - unaffected by other data
  - vitamin C supplementation
- dependent variable
  - affected by other data
  - birth gender ratio
 
# Experiments
## experiments, treatment, and control
- experiments are a subset of hypothesis testing
  - experiments are not just conducted in academia
- experiments aim to answer: what is the effect of the treatment on the response?
  - treatment: independent variable
  - response: dependent variable
 
## advertising as a treatment
- what is the effect of an advertisement on the number of products purchased?
  - treatment: advertisement
  - response: number of products purchased
 
## controlled experiments
- participants are assigned to either the treatment group or the control group
  - treatment group: sees the advertisement
  - control group: does not see the advertisement
- groups should be comparable to avoid introducing bias
- if groups are not comparable, this could lead to drawing incorrect conclusions

## the gold standard of experiments
- randomization
  - participants are assigned to treatment/control randomly, not based on any other characteristics
  - choosing randomly helps ensure that groups are comparable
  - known as a randomize controlled trial
- blinding
  - participants will not know which group they're in
  - participants receive a placebo, which resembles the treatment but has no effect
  - in clinical trials it is common to use a sugar pill
- double-blind randomized controlled trial
  - person administering the treatment/running the study doesn't know whether the treatment is real or a placebo
  - prevents bias in the response and/or analysis of results
  __fewer opportunities for bias = more reliable conclusion about causation__

## randomized controlled trials vs. A/B testing
- randomized controlled trial
  - can be multiple treatment groups
  - popular in science, clinical research
- A/B testing
  - popular in marketing, engineering
  - only split evenly into two groups
