# Writing queries
## aliasing

`SELECT * FROM year`

# SQL flavors
- both free and paid
- all used with relational databases
- vast majority of keywords are the same
- all must follow universal standards
- only the additions on top of these standards make flavors different

## two popular sql flavors
### PostgreSQL
- free and open-source relational database system
- created at the university of california, berkeley
- PostgreSQL refers to both the PostgreSQL database system and its associated SQL flavor
### SQL server

- created by microsoft
- T-SQL is microsoft's SQL flavor, used with SQL Server databases

## comparing postgresql and sql server
- like dialects of the same language

  - postgresql: limit 2 in the end
  - sql server: top(2) at the beginning
