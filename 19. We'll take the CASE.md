## CASE statements
- contains a WHEN, THEN and ELSE statement, finished with END
- `SELECT *, CASE WHEN A>B THEN 'A' WHEN B>A THEN 'B' ELSE 'C' END AS field FROM data`


# In CASE things get more complex
- add multiple logical conditions to your WHEN clause
- use AND to chain multiple conditions
- WHERE CASE WHEN ... END IS NOT NULL: to filter out null value from case statement

# CASE WHEN with aggregate functions
## in CASE you need to aggregate
- CASE statements are great for
  - categorizing data

  - aggregating data
## CASE WHEN with COUNT
