# The binomial distribution
example: coin flipping has binary outcomes, one coin flip many times will be binomial distribution

## binomial distribution
- probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent events
- for example, the number of heads in a sequence of coin flips
- described by n and p
  - n: total number of events
  - p: probability of success
 
## expected value
- expected value = n*p
  - expected number of heads out of 10 flips = 10 * 0.5 = 5

## independence
- the binomial distribution is a probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent events.
- probabilities of second event are altered due to outcome of the first
- if events are not independent, the binomial distibution does not apply

## general applications
- the binomial distribution can be used for independent events producing binary outcomes
  - clinical trial measuring drup effectiveness: effective or not
  - betting on the result of a sports match: bettor can win or lose

# The normal distribution

## what is the normal distribution?
- symmetrical
- area = 1
- curve never hits 0
- can be described by mean and standard deviation
- within one standard deviation: 68%
- within two standard deviations: 95%
- within three standard deviations: 99.7%

## why is the normal distribution important?
- lots of real-world data resembles a normal distribution
- a normal distribution is required for many statistical tests.

## Kurtosis
- a way of describing the occurrence of extreme values in a distribution
- three types of kurtosis
