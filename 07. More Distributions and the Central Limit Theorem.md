# The binomial distribution
example: coin flipping has binary outcomes, one coin flip many times will be binomial distribution

## binomial distribution
- probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent events
- for example, the number of heads in a sequence of coin flips
- described by n and p
  - n: total number of events
  - p: probability of success
 
## expected value
- expected value = n*p
  - expected number of heads out of 10 flips = 10 * 0.5 = 5

## independence
- the binomial distribution is a probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent events.
- probabilities of second event are altered due to outcome of the first
- if events are not independent, the binomial distibution does not apply
