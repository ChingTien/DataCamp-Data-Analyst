# Polar coordinates
## when should you use polar coordinates?
- almost never
- if you have a variable that is naturally circular(time of day, compass direction)

# Sensory overload
## measures of a good visualization
- how many interesting insights can your reader get from the plot?
- how quickly can they get those insights?

## chartjunk
__any element of the plot that distracts from the reader getting insight__
- pictures
- skueomorphism: reflections, shadow, etc
- extra dimensions
- ostentatiious colors or lines

# Summary
- histogram: show a distribution
- box plot: show lots of distributions
- scatter plots: compare two numeric variables
- line plots: show trend over time
- bar plot: show count by category
- dot plot: show log scale metrics by category
- pair plot: compare many variables
- correlation heatmap: show related variables
- parallel coordinates plot: find patterns across variables
- rose plot: show a cyclical distribution
