# What is statistics
## what is statistics
- the field of statistics - the practice and study of collecting and analyzing data
- two main branches of statistics:
  - descriptive/summary statistics - describing or summarizing our data
  - inferential statistics - collect a sample of data, and apply the results to the population that the sample represents

 ## Statistics is everywhere
 - sport statistics
 - personal finances

## what can statistics do?
- allow us to answer practical questions:
  - what is the average salary in the USA?
  - how many customer inquiries is a company likely to receive per week?
- it has applications across society:
    - developing safer products such as cars or airplanes
    - help governments understand the needs of a population
- validates scientific breakthroughs, such as Covid-19 vaccines

## limitations of statistics
- statistics requires specific, measurable questions:
  - is rock music more popular than jazz?
  - on average, do women live longer than men?
- we can't use statistics to find out why relationships exist

## types of data: numeric
- continuous data: stock prices
- interval/count data: how many cups of coffee do people drink per day?
 
## types of data: categorical
- nominal data: eye color
- ordinal data: how strongly do you agree that basketball is the best sport?

## descriptive/summary statistics
- describe or summarize data

## inferential statistics
- use a sample to draw conclusions about a population
- how many people purchase clothing following social media avertising?

# Measures of center
## why are measures of center useful?
- average number of sales orders per month
- typical cost of a house
- most common hair color

## what is the center of the data
- mean
- median
- mode

# Measure of spread
## why is spread important?
- spread measures the variety of our data
- t-shirt typically cost 30
  - can cost between $10-200
  - how likely is it one will cost $30?
- if t-shirts were priced between $20-50
  - does this change the likelihood of finding one for $30?
 
## range
range = maximum - minimum

## variance

## standard deviation
root of variance
__standard deviation close to zero = data clustered around the mean__

## quartiles
- quartiles: splitting the data into four equal parts
- box plots
- interquartile range(IQR): IQR is less affected by extreme values
