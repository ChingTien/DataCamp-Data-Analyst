# Correlated subqueries
## Correlated subquery
- use values from the outer query to generate a result
- re-run for every row generated in the final data set
- used for advanced joining, filtering, and evaluating data

## simple vs correlated subqueries
__simple subquery__
- can be run independently from the main query
- evaluated once in the whole query

__correlated subquery__
- dependent on the main query to execute
- evaluated in loops
  - significantly slows down query runtime

# Nested subqueries
## Nested subqueries
- subquery inside another subquery
- perform multiple layers of transformation

## correlated nested subqueries
- nested subqueries can be correlated or uncorrelated
  - or a combination of the two
  - can reference information from the outer subquery or main query

# Common table experssions
## when adding subqueries
- query complexity increases quickly
  - information can be difficult to keep track of
__solution__: common table expressions!
## common table expressions(CTEs)
- table declared before the main query
- named and referenced later in FROM statement
`WITH s AS (
...
)`

## Why use CTEs?
- executed once
  - CTE is then stored in memory
  - improves query performance
- improving organization of queries
- referencing other CTEs
- referencing itself(SELF JOIN)

# Deciding on techniques to use
## differentiating techniques
__joins__
- combine 2+ tables
  - simple operations/aggregations
__correlated subqueries__
- match subqueries&tables
  - avoid limits of joins
  - high processing time
__multiple/nested subqueries__
- multi-step transformations
  - improve accuracy and reproducibility
__common table expressions__
- organize subqueries sequentially
- can reference other CTEs

## which to use?
- depends on your database/question
- the technique that best allows you to:
  - use and reuse your queries
  - generate clear and accurate results
