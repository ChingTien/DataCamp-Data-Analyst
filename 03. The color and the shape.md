# Higher dimensions
## x and y are not the only dimensions
__points also have these dimensions__
- color
- size
- transparency
- shape

## other dimensions for line plots
- color
- thickness
- transparency
- line type(solid, dashes, dots)

# Using color
## choosing a plotting plaette
- usually, each color should stand out as much as other colors.
- the perceptual distance from one color in the plot to the next should be constant.

## Three types of color scale
- qualitative: distinguish unordered categories
- sequential: show ordering
- diverging: show above or below a midpoint

# Plotting many variables at once
## when should you use a pair plot?
- you have up to ten variables(either continuous, categorical, or a mix).
- you want to see the distribution for each variable.
- you want to see the relationship between each pair of variables.

## when should you use a correlation heatmap
- you have lots of continuous variables.
- you want a simple overview of how each pair of variables is related.

## when should you use a parallel coordinates plots?
- you have lots of continuous variables
- you want to find patterns across these variables, or
- you want to visualize clusters of observations.
