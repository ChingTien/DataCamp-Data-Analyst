# A plot tells a thousand words

## What you'll learn
- how do you choose an appropriate plot?
- how do you interpret common types of plots?
- what are best practices for drawing plots?

## Three ways of getting insights
- calculating summary statistics
  - mean, median, standard deviation
- Running models
  - linear and logistic regression
- drawing plots
  - scatter, bar, histogram

## Continuous and categorical variables
- continuous: usually numbers
  - heights, temperatures, revenues
- cateogrical: usually text
  - eye colors, countries, industry
- can be either
  - age is continuous, but age group is categorical
  - time is continuous, month of year is categorical

# Histograms

## When should you use a histogram?
- if you have a single continuous variable
- you want to ask questions about the shape of its distribution.

## Modality: how many peaks?
- one: unimodal
- two: bimodal
- three: trimodal

## skewness: is it symmetric?
- stmmetric
- left-skewed
- right-skewed

## Kurotsis: how many extreme values?
- leptokurtic: narrow peak, lots extreme values, important in finance
- mesokurtic: bell curve, normal distribution
- platykurtic: borad peak, few extreme values

# Box plots
- you can't just color in histograms, draw each histogram in its own panel.

## when should you use a box plot?
- when you have a continuous variable, split by a categorical variable
- when you want to compare the distributions of the continuous variable for each category.
