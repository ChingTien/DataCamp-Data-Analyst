## topics
- common data types in postgresql
- date and time functions and operators
- parsing and manipulating text
- full-text search and postgresql extensions

## common data types
- text data types
  - `CHAR`, `VARCHAR` and `TEXT`
- numeric data types
  - `INT` and `DECIMAL`
- date/time data types
  - `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `INTERVAL`

# Date and time data types
## timestamp data types

# working with ARRAYs
## before we get started
```
CREATE TABLE table_name 
(col1 text, col2 integer)
```

INSERT
```
INSERT INTO table_name
(col1, col2)
VALUES
('text_value', 12);
```

## Searching ARRAYs
```
SELECT 
email[1][2] as type
email[1][2] as address
test_scores[1]
FROM grades
WHERE email[1][1] = 'work'
```

## ARRAYs functions and operators I
```
SELECT
email[2][1] as type,
email[2][2] as address,
test_scores[1]
FROM grades
WHERE 'other' = ANY(email)
```

## ARRAYs functions and operators II
```
SELECT
email[2][1] as type,
email[2][2] as address,
test_scores[1]
FROM grades
WHERE email @> ARRAY['other'];
```
