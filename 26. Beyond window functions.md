# RULLUP and CUBE
## enter ROLLUP
- `SELECT * FROM data GROUP BY ROLLUP(A, B)`
- `ROLLUP` is a `GROUP BY` subclause that includes extra rows for group-level aggregations
- `GROUP BY A, ROLLUP(B)` will count all A - and B-lvel totals, then count only A-level totals and fill in B with nulls for these rows

## ROLLUP - query
- `ROLLUP` is hierarchical, de-aggregating from the leftmost provided column to the right-most
  - ROLLUP(A, B) includes A-level totals
  - ROLLUP(B, A) includes B-level totals
  - both include grand totals
## ROLLUP - result
- group-level totals contain nulls; the row with all nulls is the grand total
- notice that it didin't include B-level totals for ROLLUP(A, B)

## enter CUBE
- `SELECT * FROM data GROUP BY CUBE(A, B)`
- `CUBE` is a non-hierarchical `ROLLUP`
- it generates all possible group-level aggregations
  - CUBE(A, B) counts A-level, B-level and grand totals

## ROLLUP vs CUBE
- use `ROLLUP` when you have hierarchical data(e.g., date parts) and don't want all possible group-level aggregations
- use `CUBE` when you want all possible group-level aggregations

# A survey of useful functions
## Nulls ahoy
- nulls signify group totals

## enter COALESCE
- `COALESCE()` takes a list of values and returns the first non-null value, going from left to right
- useful when using SQL operations that return nulls
  - `ROLLUP` and `CUBE`
  - pivoting
  - `LAG` and `LEAD`
 
## annihilating nulls
`SELECT COALESCE(A, 'both A') FROM data GROUP BY ROLLUP(A, B)`

## compressing data
__enter STRING_AGG__
- STRING_AGG(column, separator) takes all the values of a column and concatenates them, with `separator` in between each value
