# Aggregate window functions
## aggregate functions
- MAX query - MAX window function: MAX(col) OVER (ORDER BY ...) = rolling MAX
- SUM query - SUM window function: SUM(col) OVER (ORDER BY ...) = rolling SUM
- partitiong with aggregate window functions: SUM(col) OVER (PARTITION BY ...)

# Frames

## window function syntax
`window_function(window_name/expression) OVER
(
[partition_definition] [order_definition] [frame_definition]
)`

## motivation
__LAST_VALUE__
- frame: RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
- without the frame, LAST_VALUE would return the row's value in the column
- by default, a frame start at the beginning of a table or partition and ends at the current row

## ROWS BETWEEN
- ROW BETWEEN [START] AND [FINISH]
  - `n PRECEDING`: `n` rows before the current row
  - `CURRENT ROW`: the current row
  - `n FOLLOWING`: `n` rows after the current row
__examples__
- ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
- ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
- ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
