# Fetching
## the four functions
__relative__
- `LAG(column, n)` returns `column's` value at the row `n` rows before the current row
- `LEAD(column, n)` returns `column's` value at the row `n` rows after the current row
__absolute__
- `FIRST_VALUE(column)` returns the first value in the table or partition
- `LAST_VALUE(column)` returns the last value in the table or partition

## RANGE BETWEEN
- by default, a window starts at the beginning of the table or partition and ends at the current row
- `RANGE BETWEEN` clause extends the window to the end of the table or partition

# Ranking
## the ranking functions
- `ROW_NUMBER()` always assigns unique numbers, even if two row's values are the same
- `RANK()` assigns the same number to rows with identical values, skipping over the next numbers in such cases
- `DENSE_RANK()` also assigns the same number to rows with identical values, but doesn't skip over the next numbers

## different ranking functions
- `ROW_NUMBER` and `RANK` will have the same last rank, the count of rows
- `DENSE_RANK`'s last rank is the count of unique values being ranked

# Paging
## what is paging
- paging: splitting data into (approximately) equal chunks
- uses:
  - many APIs return data in 'pages' to reduce data being sent
  - separating data into quartiles or thirds (top middle 33%, and bottom thirds) to judge performance

  ## enter NTILE
  - `NTILE(n)` splits the data into `n` approximately equal pages
