# What are the chances?
## measureing chance
- what is the probability of an event?
  - p = # ways event can happen/total # possible outcomes
  - example: a coin flip: p(head) = 1 way to get heads / 2 possible outcomes = 1 / 2 = 50%
 
## independent probability
- sampling with replacement
- two events are independent if the probability of the second evernt does not change based on the outcome of the first event.

# Conditional probability
- conditional probability is used to calculate the probability of dependent events
  - the probability of one event is conditional on the outcome of another

## dependent events
- sampling without replacement
- two events are dependent if the probability of the second event is affected by the outcome of the first event.
- sampling without replacement = each pick is dependent

## conditional probability formula
- P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
- probablity of event A, given event B
- probablity of event A and event B
  - divide by the probability of event B
 
# Discrete distributions
## probability distribution
- describes the probability of each possible outcome in a scenario
- expected value: the mean of a probability distribution

## why are probability distribution important?
- help us toe quantify risk and inform decision making
- used extensively in hypothesis testing
  - probability that the results occurred by chance

## law of large numbers
- as the size of your sample increase, the sample mean will approach the expected value.

## continuous distributions
