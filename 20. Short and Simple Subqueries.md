# WHERE are the subqueries?
## what is a subquery
- a query nested inside another query
- useful for intermediary transformation

## what do you do with subqueries
- can be in any part of a query
  - SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY
- can return a variety of information
  - scalar quantities
  - a list
  - a table
 
## why subqueries
- comparing groups to summarized values
  - how did team A compare team B's average performance for this year?
- reshaping data
  - what is the highest monthly average of goals scored in the US?
- combining data that cannot be joined
  - how do you get both the home and away team names into a table of match results?
 
## simple subqueries
- can be evaluated independently from the outer query
- is only processed once in the entire statement

# Subqueries in the FROM statement
## subqueries in FROM
- resturcture and transform you data
  - transforming data from long to wide before selecting
  - prefiltering data
- calculating aggregates of aggregates

## things to remember
- you can created multiple subqueries in one FROM statement
  - alias them
  - join them
- you can join a subquery to a table in FROM
  - include a joining columns in both tables
 
# Subqueries in SELECT
## SELECTing what?
- return a single value
  - include aggregate values to compare to individual values
- used in mathematical calculations
  - deviation from the average
 
## SELECT subqueries - things to keep in mind
- need to retuen a  SINGLE value
  - will generate an error otherwise
- make sure you have all filters in the right places
  - properly filter both the main and the subquery!


# Subqueries everywhere! And best practices!
## AS many subqueries as you want...
- can include multiple subqueries in SELECT, FROM, WHERE
## Format your queries
- line up SELECT, FROM, WHERE and GROUP BY
## Annotate your queries
## Indent your queries
- indent your subqueries!

## is that subquery necessary>
- subqueries require computing power
  - how big is your database?
  - how big is the table you're querying from?
- is the subquery actually necessary?
## properly filter each subquery!
- watch your filters!
