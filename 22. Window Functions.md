# Window Functions
## working with aggregate values
- requires you to use GROUP BY with all non-aggregate columns

## keyword: OVER()
## template
`
window_function(expression) OVER
(
[PARTITION BY]
[ORDER BY]
)
`
## introducing window functions
- perform calculations on an already generated result set(a window)
- aggregate calculations
  - similar to subqueries in SELECT
  - running total, rankings, moving averages

## what's a window functions
## key differences
- processed after every part of query except `ORDER BY`
  - uses information in result set rather than database
- available in PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, SQL server...
  - but NOT SQLite

# Window Partitions
## OVER and PARTITION BY
- calculate separate values for different categories
- calculate different calculations in the same column

## PARTITION BY considerations
- can partition data by 1+ columns
- can partition aggregate calculations, ranks, etc

# Sliding windows
## Sliding windows
- perform calculations relative to the current row
- can be used to calculate running total, sums, averages, etc
- can be partitioned by one or more columns

## Sliding window keywords
`ROWS BETWEEN <start> AND <finish>` <br>

```
PRECEDING
FOLLOWING
UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
CURRENT ROW
```
- ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
- ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

# Bringing it all Together
## what you've learned so far
- CASE statement
- simple subqueries
- nested and correlated subqueries
- common table expressions
- window functions

## steps to construct the query
- get team names with CTEs
- get match outcome with CASE statements
- determine how badly they lost with a window function
