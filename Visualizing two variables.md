# Scatter plots

## when should you use a scatter plot?
- you have two continuous variables
- you want to answer questions about the relationship between the two variables.

## correlation
- how close are you to being able to fit a straight line through the points?
  - strong negative, weak negative, no correlation, weak positive, strong positive
- sometimes correlation isn't helpful
  - adding (smooth) trend lines

# Line plots
## when should you use a line plot?
- you have two continuous variables
- you want to answer questions about their relationship
- consecutive observations are connected somehow
- usually, but now always, the x-axis is dates or times.
